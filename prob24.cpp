//A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
//
//012   021   102   120   201   210
//
//What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

    // There are 9! permutations of the digits 1-9.
    // So, we know that 9! is less than 1 million and that the smallest 9! permutations have 0 as their first digit.
    // This means that 0 cannot be the first digit of the 1 millionth permutation.
    // This also means that the 1 millionth permutation is 10 digits long, or above 1 billion.
    // Since 9! is also less than half of 1 million, we know the first digit is not a 1 either.
    // Therefore you can start at index 2*9! and ignore all permutations that start with either 0 or 1.
    // This means that the 1 millionth permutation is above 2 billion, since it must have 10 digits and not start with a 0 or 1.
    // However, since 3*9! is above 1 million so we know that the 1 millionth permutation starts with a 2 since
    // all permutations in an ordered list with index 2*9!+1 to 3*9! must start with 2.
